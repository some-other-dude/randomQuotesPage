I initially built a version (incomplete) with a large background image.  After thinking it through, I was putting a lot of fluff in that did not add value to the exercise.  I branched this version into withBackgroundPicture and started from scratch to see how fast I could build the page per the spec. The new branch is withFadingColors.
